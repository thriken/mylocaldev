	<h2>What's this about?</h2>
	<p>It is not a MVC framework, it is not a CSS/Grid framework. Vanilla Kit is a very simple php powered dynamic website template to kickstart a small to medium sized project that does not require a CMS. It aims to ease the task of web designers to quickly setup and develop an organized and easy to edit website, it uses some basic PHP to separate the static parts of the website from the page content, and do the 'ol dynamic fetch page.</p>
	<p>Just change some titles around, create your page files, add your html, style them with your own css, and it's ready to rock. Simple tasks like adding page titles, description and keywords on a per page basis has also been taken care of. It's simplicity leaves out room to improve or add other functionalities you might require.</p>
	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>It's straight out of my own tool box and i use it for specific cases where no CMS or complicated content requirements are in demand. I decided to polish it up and drop it on Github for anybody who wants to make use of it.</p>
